PROBLEM 62
Write a program to print the output of the following poblem statement :-
Itâ€™s a real-world data containing the details of 
      titanic ships passengers list.
      Import the training set "training_titanic.csv"
      
      PassengerId
      survival: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
      pclass: Passenger Class (1 = Upper; 2 = Middle; 3 = Lower)
      name: Name
      sex: Sex
      age: Age 
      sibsp: Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
      parch: Number of Parents/Children Aboard
      ticket: Ticket Number
      fare: Passenger Fare
      cabin: Cabin
      embarked: Port of Embarkation 
      (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
      
  Answer the Following:
      How many people survived the disaster ?
      
      How many people died ?
      
      Calculate the survival rates as proportions (percentage)
      
      Males that survived vs males that passed away
      
      Females that survived vs Females that passed away      
      
      Does age play a role?
      Since it's probable that children were saved first?
