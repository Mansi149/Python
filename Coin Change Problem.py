PROBLEM 76
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, 
and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} 
valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order 
of coins doesnâ€™t matter.For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, 
there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So 
output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are 
five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and 
{5,5}?
